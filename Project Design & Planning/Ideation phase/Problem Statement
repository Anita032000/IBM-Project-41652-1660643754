Chronic kidney disease, also known as CKD, threatens the lifespan of a person if it is not diagnosed in its early stages. With more than 1 in 7 suffering from ckd in the US, availing the aid of medical personnel to detect early symptoms of CKD is inefficient. We propose a solution wherein if required data is available, this problem can be easily solved by running a machine learning model which can predict presence of ckd.
